# APS1070 – Data Analytics and Machine Learning (Graduate Course)

This repository contains the four completed projects for **APS1070: Data Analytics and Machine Learning**, a graduate-level course at the **University of Toronto**.

## 📘 Course Overview

APS1070 introduces the foundational concepts and tools used in modern data science and machine learning. The course combines programming, mathematical theory, and applied machine learning techniques. Topics covered include:

- **Python for Data Science**: Jupyter, NumPy, pandas, data wrangling, and visualization
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Linear algebra, matrix decompositions, vector calculus, and optimization
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Linear regression, nearest neighbors, anomaly detection, regularization, and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

The course emphasizes hands-on learning through a series of practical projects.

## 🧠 Project Summaries

### 📊 Project 1 – Basic Data Science
- Practiced Python, NumPy, and pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Explored real-world datasets to perform data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistics.
- Built a simple k-nearest neighbors classifier from scratch.

### 🚨 Project 2 – Anomaly Detection
- Implemented anomaly detection techniques using multivariate Gaussian models.
- Identified outliers in high-dimensional datasets using statistical thresholds.
- Applied matrix operations and vectorized computation for performance.

### 📈 Project 3 – Linear Regression
- Developed linear regression models with and without regularization (Ridge/Lasso).
- Analyzed overfitting and underfitting across different model complexities.
- Used gradient descent and matrix-based closed-form solutions.

### 🔍 Project 4 – Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.
- Explored eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and covariance matrices.
- Demonstrated how PCA can capture major patterns and reduce noise in data.
